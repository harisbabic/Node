# Project Structure

## Overview
The `/d/Node` project is structured to support modular and scalable development. The project holds other projects inside the `projects/` directory, which are created through automation using shell scripts.

## Key Directories
- **`/utils`**: Contains shell scripts for automating project setup.
- **`/projects`**: Contains all generated projects, including the latest `test_project`.
- **`/docs`**: Documentation and action plans for ongoing development.

## Modular Design
The modular design of `/d/Node` allows for easy expansion and integration of new features. Each project is isolated within its directory, allowing for targeted development and testing.

## Test Project
The `test_project` is the latest project created by the `master-setup.sh` script. It serves as a reference for verifying the setup process and testing new features.
