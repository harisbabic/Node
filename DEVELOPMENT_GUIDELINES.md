# Project Development Guidelines

## Working Rules and Instructions

### 1. File Paths and Names
- Always provide relative paths with file names commented at the top of each generated file.
- Use consistent naming conventions (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components).

### 2. Project Context
- We're working on advancing our '/d/Node' project.
- The project is built with Node.js, npm, PostgreSQL, React, Express, and other related technologies.
- Development is done on a Windows 10 machine, using Git Bash for command line operations.

### 3. Code Generation and Adaptation
- When generating new code or adapting functionality from other projects (e.g., Ai-toolbox, web-tools), ensure it's compatible with our Node project structure and technologies.
- Adjust imports, file paths, and dependencies as necessary to fit our project structure.

### 4. Documentation
- Keep documentation up-to-date, especially when introducing new features or making significant changes.
- Use clear, concise language in comments and documentation.

### 5. Testing
- Write and update tests for new features and changes.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting pull requests.

### 6. Version Control
- Make meaningful commit messages that clearly describe the changes made.
- Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or bug fix when possible.

### 7. Error Handling and Logging
- Implement proper error handling in all new code.
- Use the project's logging system consistently.

### 8. Security
- Always consider security implications when writing code or suggesting changes.
- Never commit sensitive information (like API keys or passwords) to the repository.

### 9. Performance
- Consider the performance implications of your code, especially for database operations and API calls.

### 10. Accessibility
- Ensure new UI components are accessible and follow WCAG guidelines.

### 11. Complete and Meaningful Code Generation
- Ensure that generated files are as complete as possible, avoiding placeholders or incomplete examples.
- Each file should be production-ready, with meaningful implementations and tests.
- Only use placeholders when absolutely necessary, and clearly mark them for later completion.
- Focus on generating meaningful and thorough tests for each module, avoiding generic or example tests that do not fully assess functionality.

### 12. Streamlining Content**
   - Ensure no redundant information is present.
   - Organize the `Features` section logically, starting with core features like creating the Database Schema, then working your way  through Project Management and moving to advanced features like the Server-Side Dashboard and Analytics.

## Reference
- Review these rules regularly and before generating any code or responses.
- Helps maintain consistency and quality throughout the project.
