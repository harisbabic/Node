# Working Rules and Instructions

To maintain consistency and clarity in our project development, please adhere to the following rules:

1. File Paths and Names:
   - Always provide relative paths with file names commented at the top of each generated file.
   - Use consistent naming conventions (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components).

2. Project Context:
   - We're working on advancing our '/d/Node' project.
   - The project is built with Node.js, npm, PostgreSQL, React, Express, and other related technologies.
   - Development is done on a Windows 10 machine, using Git Bash for command line operations.

3. Code Generation and Adaptation:
   - When generating new code or adapting functionality from other projects (e.g., Ai-toolbox, web-tools), ensure it's compatible with our Node project structure and technologies.
   - Adjust imports, file paths, and dependencies as necessary to fit our project structure.

4. Documentation:
   - Keep documentation up-to-date, especially when introducing new features or making significant changes.
   - Use clear, concise language in comments and documentation.

5. Testing:
   - Write and update tests for new features and changes.
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting pull requests.

6. Version Control:
   - Make meaningful commit messages that clearly describe the changes made.
   - Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or bug fix when possible.

7. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Implement proper error handling in all new code.
   - Use the project's logging system consistently.

8. Security:
   - Always consider security implications when writing code or suggesting changes.
   - Never commit sensitive information (like API keys or passwords) to the repository.

9. Performance:
   - Consider the performance implications of your code, especially for database operations and API calls.

10. Accessibility:
    - Ensure new UI components are accessible and follow WCAG guidelines.

Remember to review these rules regularly and before generating any code or responses. This helps maintain consistency and quality throughout the project.
