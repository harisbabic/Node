# Working Rules

## Code Style
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces for JavaScript, 4 spaces for Python, etc.).
- Use meaningful variable names.
- Write comments for complex logic or non-obvious code.

## Best Practices
- Commit often with clear messages.
- Ensure all scripts are executable with `chmod +x`.
- Test all changes before pushing.

## Examples
- **Good Commit Message**: `Added user authentication routes and middleware`
- **Bad Commit Message**: `Fix`

## Contributions
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch for each feature or fix.
- Submit a pull request with a detailed description.
