# /d/Node Project

## Overview
The `/d/Node` project is an environment designed to automate the setup of new projects. It includes a variety of utility scripts, a `master-setup.sh` script, and a modular structure for client and server components. The primary goal is to provide a streamlined development environment with built-in support for PostgreSQL, automation, and advanced features.

## Key Components
- **`master-setup.sh`**: Orchestrates the entire project setup.
- **Utility Scripts**: Found in `/d/Node/utils`, these scripts automate various tasks, including project creation, database setup, and more.
- **Modular Directory Structure**: Organizes code into logical subdirectories for easy navigation and scalability.
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: The default database for backend operations.
