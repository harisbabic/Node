- `DemTech`: Democracy-focused tech solutions
- `web-tools`: Business management and directory tools
- `test_project`: Demonstrates basic project setup
- `ultimate`: Comprehensive example of all features

These projects serve as sources of functionality to be integrated into the main /d/Node environment. They are continuously evolving and may be removed once fully integrated.

## Development Workflow:

- **Schema Implementation**:
   - Start by defining these models in your PostgreSQL database, ensuring that all relationships and constraints are clearly established.
