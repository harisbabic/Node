## Features

- **Project Management**: Manage tasks, projects, and user assignments with ease.
   - **Visual Task Management**: Boards, lists, and cards provide a simple yet powerful way to organize tasks.
   - **Collaboration**: Easy-to-use collaboration tools with comments, attachments, and user assignments.
- **Client Management**:
   - **CRM Integration**: Having a robust Client Relationship Management (CRM) system with client profiles, contracts, invoicing that allows for detailed tracking of client interactions, proposals, contracts, and payments. Clients should be linked to Projects and should have detailed profiles that include contact information, notes, and tags for organization.
   - **Client Portal**: A dedicated portal where clients can view project progress, invoices, contracts, and communications is crucial for transparency and ease of access.
- **Financial Management**:
   - **Invoicing and Payments**: Automating invoicing with features like recurring payments and late fee reminders can streamline the financial aspects of project management. Invoices should be tied to specific projects and clients.
   - **Budgeting and Expenses**: Real-time budget tracking and expense logging are essential for keeping projects on track financially. This data should be integrated with project and task management to provide a comprehensive overview.
- **Automation and Integrations**:
   - **Automated Workflows**: Automating routine tasks, such as sending reminders, updating project statuses, and tracking time, can significantly increase efficiency.
   - **Integrations**: Allowing integrations with other tools, such as calendars, email clients, and financial software, can enhance the functionality and flexibility of the platform.
- **Server-Side Dashboard With Drag-and-Drop Development Functionality**: A powerful dashboard for managing users, projects, and analytics from the backend.
- **Dynamic Form Builder**: Create custom forms using a drag-and-drop interface, tailored to your specific needs.
- **Business and Event Management**: Organize and promote businesses, schedule events, and manage services within the application.
- **Polls and Reviews**: Engage with users through polls and collect valuable feedback with a built-in review system.
- **Component-Based Structure**:
   - Inspired by Retool’s component library, we should consider a modular approach in our schema design where different components (e.g., Projects, Tasks, Clients) can be independently developed and then integrated.
- **Data Connectivity**:
   - Ensure our system is capable of integrating with various databases and external APIs, allowing for flexible data sources, similar to Retool’s universal connectivity.
- **Security and Auditability**:
   - Implement robust security features in our schema, including user roles, audit logs, and secure data handling practices. This is crucial for any enterprise-level application.
- **Advanced Features**:
   - **No-Code Flexibility**: Allows for the creation of highly customizable apps using a no-code approach, which can be beneficial for future adaptability.
   - **Comprehensive Permissions**: Detailed user roles and permissions management, ensuring that data access is controlled.
   - **Integration and Automation**: Powerful integration capabilities with APIs and third-party tools, coupled with workflow automation.
   - **Advanced Debugging and Deployment Tools**: Robust tools with capabilities to monitor application performance and manage different environments, which can be essential for maintaining a high-quality product.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version x.x.x)
- PostgreSQL (version x.x.x)
- Other dependencies as required (listed in `package.json`)

### Setup Instructions

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harisbabic/Node.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the setup scripts:
   - **PostgreSQL Setup**:
     ```bash
     sh utils/setup-postgresql.sh
     ```
   - **Database Setup**:
     ```bash
     sh utils/setup-database.sh
     ```
4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
## Usage
- **Managing Projects**: Navigate to the Projects section to create, update, and manage your projects.
- **Building Forms**: Use the Form Builder to create custom forms by dragging and dropping form elements.
- **Organizing Events**: Schedule and manage events from the Events section, with options to sell tickets and gather RSVPs.
- **Server-Side Management**: Access the server-side dashboard to manage all backend functionalities.

## Utility Scripts
The `utils/` directory contains various scripts to automate project setup and management. See the [Utils README](utils/README.md) for details on each script.

## Reference Projects
The `projects/` directory contains several reference projects:
- `ai-toolbox`: AI-related functionalities
- `DemTech`: Democracy-focused tech solutions
- `web-tools`: Business management and directory tools
- `test_project`: Demonstrates basic project setup
- `ultimate`: Comprehensive example of all features

These projects serve as sources of functionality to be integrated into the main /d/Node environment. They are continuously evolving and may be removed once fully integrated.

## Development Workflow:

- **Schema Implementation**:
   - Start by defining these models in your PostgreSQL database, ensuring that all relationships and constraints are clearly established.
- **Core Features**:
   - **User Authentication**: Implement robust authentication and role-based access control based on the User Model.
   - **Project and Task Management**: Develop the Project and Task management modules, incorporating the visual and collaborative elements inspired by Trello.
   - **Client and Financial Management**: Integrate the Client and Invoice models to handle CRM and financial tasks, inspired by Hello Bonsai.
- **Advanced Features**:
   - **Automation and Workflows**: Implement the Automation Rules model, allowing users to set up custom workflows, similar to Trello's Butler.
   - **API Integrations**: Plan for future integrations with external APIs, following the flexible approach of Retool and Noloco.
- **Testing and Iteration**:
   - Ensure that each module is thoroughly tested before moving on to the next. Use real-world scenarios to validate the system's robustness and flexibility.
