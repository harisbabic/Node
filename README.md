## Utility Scripts
The `utils/` directory contains various scripts to automate project setup and management. See the [Utils README](utils/README.md) for details on each script.

## Reference Projects
The `projects/` directory contains several reference projects:
- `ai-toolbox`: AI-related functionalities
- `DemTech`: Democracy-focused tech solutions
- `web-tools`: Business management and directory tools
- `test_project`: Demonstrates basic project setup
- `ultimate`: Comprehensive example of all features

These projects serve as sources of functionality to be integrated into the main /d/Node environment. They are continuously evolving and may be removed once fully integrated.

## Development Workflow:

- **Schema Implementation**:
   - Start by defining these models in your PostgreSQL database, ensuring that all relationships and constraints are clearly established.

- **Advanced Features**:
   - **Automation and Workflows**: Implement the Automation Rules model, allowing users to set up custom workflows, similar to Trello's Butler.
   - **API Integrations**: Plan for future integrations with external APIs, following the flexible approach of Retool and Noloco.
- **Testing and Iteration**:
   - Ensure that each module is thoroughly tested before moving on to the next. Use real-world scenarios to validate the system's robustness and flexibility.
