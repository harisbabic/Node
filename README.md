## Key Components

### Utility Scripts
Located in the `/utils` directory, these shell scripts automate various setup and generation tasks:
- `master-setup.sh`: Sets up a new project

### Projects
- `ultimate`: The latest project generated using our setup scripts.
- `ai-toolbox`, `DemTech`, `web-tools`: Reference projects for extracting functionality.

### Documentation
- `Node-Project-Current-State.md`: Current state of the `/d/Node` project, focusing on the `ultimate` project.
- `Action-Plan-Master.md`: Detailed action plan for project development.
- `Roadmap.md`: High-level project roadmap.

## Working with This Repository
1. To set up a new project, use the `master-setup.sh` script in the `utils/` directory.
2. Refer to `WORKING_RULES.md` for our development guidelines.
3. The `projects/` directory contains both active and reference projects.
4. Additional shell scripts pending implementation are in `additional-sh-scripts/`.

## Current Focus
We are currently working on enhancing the `/d/Node` project, with a focus on the `ultimate` project in the `projects/` directory. Our goal is to improve project setup automation and incorporate functionality from reference projects.
