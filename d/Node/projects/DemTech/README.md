# DemTech

This directory contains code samples and utilities focused on democratic technology solutions. These are intended for integration into the main /d/Node environment project.

## Purpose

- Provide reference implementations for democracy-focused tech solutions
- Serve as a source for extracting and adapting relevant code into the main /d/Node project

## Contents

- Voting system implementation examples
- Transparency tool utilities
- Civic engagement platform components

## Note

This is not a complete project. The code here is meant to be reviewed, adapted, and integrated into the main /d/Node environment as needed. Once integration is complete, this directory may be removed from the repository.

## Usage in /d/Node Development

When incorporating these democratic technology solutions into the /d/Node project:
1. Review the relevant code snippets in this directory
2. Adapt the code to fit the /d/Node project structure and coding standards
3. Integrate the adapted code into the appropriate location in the /d/Node project
4. Ensure proper testing and documentation of the newly integrated features

## Contributing

For guidelines on how to contribute to the main /d/Node project, please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file in the /d/Node root directory.
