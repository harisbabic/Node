# AI Toolbox

This directory contains code snippets and utilities related to AI-powered tools. These are intended to be incorporated into the /d/Node environment project.

## Purpose

- Provide reference implementations for AI-driven functionalities
- Serve as a source for extracting and adapting AI-related code into the main /d/Node project

## Contents

- AI-driven code generation utilities
- Machine learning model integration examples
- Natural language processing utility functions

## Note

This is not a standalone project. The code here is meant to be reviewed, adapted, and integrated into the main /d/Node environment as needed. Once integration is complete, this directory may be removed from the repository.

## Usage in /d/Node Development

When incorporating these AI functionalities into the /d/Node project:
1. Review the relevant code snippets in this directory
2. Adapt the code to fit the /d/Node project structure and coding standards
3. Integrate the adapted code into the appropriate location in the /d/Node project
4. Ensure proper testing and documentation of the newly integrated features

## Contributing

For guidelines on how to contribute to the main /d/Node project, please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file in the /d/Node root directory.
